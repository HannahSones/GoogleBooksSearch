## Functionality  
![Google Book Search](https://github.com/HannahSones/GoogleBooksSearch/blob/main/client/public/GoogleBooksApp.gif?raw=true)   

Search for the name of a book or author in the search bar to find related results from Google's books API. A list of results will appear below where you can then click to view the book or save it to your saved books. If you click the saved button in the top right hand side you will see a list of all saved books. These can be removed from the list by clicking the remove button.

-------------

## Installation
1. Clone the code from the GitHub repo
2. Open project directory, then install all required dependencies using `npm install`
3. Enter `npm start` to run the application in development mode in your localhost
4. The page will reload if you make edits thanks to nodemon. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

------------------
## Deployed link   
Or you can view the live deployment of the application on [Heroku](https://powerful-castle-62096.herokuapp.com/).

-------------
## Further Development
If I had more time available, I would like to improve the app by:
* Having a list of previous searches for quick and easy access. This could be saved in the local storage.
* Improving the user interface to make it more engaging
* Adding a share option on users saved books so they can share their lists with friends
